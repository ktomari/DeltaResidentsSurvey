## Introduction

This is the Delta Residents Survey (DRS) repository for all the scripts needed to load and analyze the survey data from 2023. The survey was conducted in the first quarter of 2023, reaching over 2,300 Delta and Delta-adjacent residents of the California Delta. Among other things, the survey included questions on well-being and environmental changes.

## Summary Report

The summary report is temporarily available [here](https://ucdavis.box.com/s/34kmt02f87ohhbpij9hu0iesubm15781), and will become available on the Delta Stewardship Council website soon. A screen-reader friendly version will be uploaded in the coming weeks as well. Additional materials will be posted as they become available. Please check back in early 2024.

## Data

The publicly available data set will be published in the coming months (late 2023 to early 2024).
