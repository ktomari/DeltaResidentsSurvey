It searches these columns for values that match a regex pattern consisting of text enclosed between angle brackets, eg. \"&lt;Decline to answer&gt;\". It then converts these values to standard NA values. In the case of factors, this algorithm drops missing levels (eg. \"&lt;Decline to answer&gt;\").\ndrs_read()\nThis is the primary function to load the DRS data set. The output is a standard tibble. This algorithm depends on the function drs_as_NA.\nThis function applies a number of tests to ensure that the data conform to the quality and structure of the original data as specified by the DRS team. More specifically, this algorithm reproduces the complex underlying data structure of the original unpublished data set. Because we decided to limit public access to personally identifiable information, and because the data were originally stored in a format that requires intimate knowledge of both the SPSS sav data format and the R {haven} package, the DRS team determined to instead supply a modified data set for public use. This complex data set is divided into two interrelated components that require processing to unify them into a workable R data structure. As such, we highly encourage DRS data users to utilize the algorithm specified in this function."

    "text": "3 Function Pseudocode\nThis section provides an overview of the algorithm present in the DRS functions script. These algorithms are written in pseudocode to provide non-R users with a method to translate the R script into the language of your choice. Given that languages like Python remain a popular data science language, and given our lack of expertise outside of the R language, we hope this prosaic description offers some utility.\n\n3.1 drs_read\n\nMake sure the argument .path satisfies some of the requirements of a file path. Given differences between Windows and Unix based filesystems, it makes no assumptions about the directory structure. So, it merely makes sure the path is a character (as even the output of file.path is a character), and that the vector supplied is of length 1.\nLoad packages. Using a combination of lapply and invisible we can silently load packages that have not been attached to the R environment. All but one of the packages are standard packages within the tidyverse. This lone package is {digest}, which serves as a means to validate the data checksum (described below).\nValidate files. This is the first formal section of this function (ie. listed in the document outline). It derives a list of files in the directory path specified by .path. It creates a tibble listing all required files. Then using map_vec to search each file name in the directory for the regex of one of the required files. This allows us to match file names to the required files needed to load DRS data. In other words, here we identify that there is a file for the data dictionary, the data itself, and the hash code (discussed later). This section concludes with an if statement that verifies that all these files are present.\nValidate data. Read the checksum hash code. Make certain that the hash code follows the structure of a SHA-256 hash with 64 characters. Apply the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function on the actual DRS data stored in the directory as a csv file. The concluding if statement simply compares the checksum hash code to the newly created hash for the csv data. In summary, this section affirms that the data hasn’t become corrupted somehow.\nLoad dictionary. Read the data dictionary from the xlsx file. Then, clean up the dictionary so it doesn’t have empty rows, and each item is affixed to one of the DRS column variables. Notice the naming structure of the data dictionary table headers. Among these headers includes “name” and “value”. This naming scheme is meant to mimic the dictionaries generated by SPSS. These key-pairs will eventually help us structure the DRS data (ie. the output).\nLoad data. Our primary objective is to correctly assign columns to their appropriate data types (eg. character, factor, numeric, or date-time) as we read the DRS data into the R environment. Thus, before using read_csv, we have to do some administrative work to accomplish this objective. We want to first identify the order that columns/variables in the csv appear, and then their order in the data dictionary. We want to ensure that we can correctly match each column of the csv to their appropriate data type in the dictionary. This produce the object col_order. Then we process the data dictionary to get a tibble of each variable and their data type, producing r_class. Note that read_csv accepts an argument col_types that specifies the R class of each column. The argument accepts a string, with each character in the string corresponding to the sequence of columns. So, fff would suggest we are reading a table with three factor columns, or Tc would suggest we are reading a table with two columns: first a date-time then a character column. This section concludes with read_csv being invoked with the col_types specified according to the data dictionary.\nSet the order of ordinal values. By inspecting the data dictionary carefully, you should notice that some factor variables have a specified encoding. This column identifies the numeric encoding that the original data set we received included. As the original data set was generated in SPSS and read into R using {haven}, we had the option of viewing the data as either encoded numbers or textual values. For instance, question Q1_0 has three possible factors: Decline to answer, No, and Yes. These values could alternatively represented by numbers: 99, 0, and 1 respectively. While these encodings do not always correspond to a specific order or sequence, some variables do have some where the order matters. For example, question Q10 has a diverging scale of possible responses, that range from Very satisfied to Very dissatisfied (along with an option to decline to answer). In this case, and in cases with sequence like income groupings that scale from low income to high income, the order matters. Thus, the objective of this section is to preserve the order.\nWe begin by splitting the data dictionary by Variable. This yields a list object, vars_. Then, using map we derive a list with elements either consisting of NULL (ie. variables without a specific order), or a tibble with the appropriate encoding. After cleaning up the output (fcts_), we use map again to produce a complete data set with correctly ordered ordinal variables. This map function relies on fct_relevel to sort the variable’s factors according to the order presented in the data dictionary (and stored in the variable fcts_).\nConvert NAs. This section is conditional, meaning it only runs if the user specifies the argument convert_to_NA as TRUE in the function call. Using one of the other DRS functions, drs_as_NA, we convert variables with values that match the regex pattern \"^\\\\&lt;.+\\\\&gt;$\" (eg. &lt;Decline to answer&gt;).\nAfter these bracketed missingness values are converted to NA values, we then convert variables described as “factor - numeric” in the dictionary to simple numeric variables. This special case only appears twice in the whole survey, and only once in the publicly available data set. One of these, Q1a, asks respondents about how long they have lived in the Delta. Responses are typed entries that indicate a time span in terms of years. In other words, respondents type in a number. However, respondents may have also skipped the question (ie. “”) or stated that this question doesn’t apply to them (perhaps because they do not identify as living in the Delta; their response appears as “”). These two non-numeric responses are identified as “factors” initially. But once they are converted to NA values, we can treat the variable as a numeric data type.\nReorganize the data and return it. As the final step of this function, the data set has its columns re-ordered to match the order of variables in the data dictionary. The final output of the function is a tibble."

    "text": "Introduction\nCalifornia relies on the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, the largest estuary on the west coast, that serves as a hub for freshwater resources distributed across the state, a biodiverse ecosystem, productive agricultural land, and a crossroads for statewide infrastructure and transportation networks. Historic towns, cultural resources, and recreational opportunities pepper the rural interior Delta, which lies only miles away from the significant metropolitan areas that make up the urban Delta perimeter. In 2009, the Delta Reform Act created the Delta Stewardship Council to advance California’s “coequal goals” for the Delta: “a more reliable statewide water supply and a resilient Delta ecosystem – in a manner that protects and enhances the unique characteristics of the Delta as an evolving place where people live, work, and recreate” (Wat. Code, § 85000 et seq.). The Council houses the Delta Science Program, which is tasked with providing the best possible scientific information to inform water and environmental management decisions for the Delta that aim to advance the coequal goals.\nDespite statutory guidance calling for a complex balance of competing needs in the estuary and science-informed decision-making, the social and human dimensions of the Delta have been vastly understudied to date, in comparison to the physical and ecological components of the system (Bidenweg; Delta Independent Science Board, Monitoring Enterprise Review; Delta Independent Science Board, Review of Research on the Sacraemnto-San Joaquin Delta as an Evolving Place). While decades of monitoring the ecological health of the system have informed management approaches for ecosystem recovery, there has been significantly less attention to monitoring or evaluating the social health of the estuary, including how people influence ecological outcomes of interest.\nIn contexts like the Delta where people deeply impact and are impacted by the state of the natural system, understanding the people who live, work, play and depend on the environment is essential to developing effective and equitable management approaches. Moreover, people are at the heart of designing, supporting and implementing estuary recovery and resilience- building efforts, which are necessary in order to meet the state’s coequal goals for the Delta. Understanding and tracking change in the human dimensions of the estuary– such as residents’ opinions on regional priorities and concerns, stewardship behaviors, and experiences– will be essential to achieving the coequal goals.\nThe development of the 2023 Delta Residents Survey is one of multiple recent efforts supported by the Delta Stewardship Council’s Social Science Integration Team and the Bay-Delta Social Science Community of Practice to begin better understanding and incorporating the human dimensions of the Delta into decision making. The Delta Residents Survey (DRS) was designed by a team of social science researchers working closely with Delta Stewardship Council staff, other partner state and local agencies, and community partners.\nThe DRS had four substantive research aims:\n\nCharacterize residents’ sense of place;\nAssess well-being of a diverse and evolving population living in the region;\nUnderstand residents’ experiences and perceptions of environmental and climate changes across the estuary;\nEvaluate residents’ civic engagement and perceptions of governance in the region.\n\nThe data were collected via a survey (available online and print version), with survey invitations sent by mail to a random sample of 82,000 households in the rural “Primary Zone” of the Delta (survey Zone 1), the suburban and urban “Secondary Zone” of the Delta (survey Zone 2) and Delta-adjacent “EJ Communities” in South Sacramento and South Stockton (survey Zone 3). The survey was available in English and Spanish. The survey included 43 multiple choice and short response questions, based on well-tested survey questions with input from the survey advisory group and Delta community members to ensure questions were appropriately locally tailored. See Table 1 below for a summary of the survey sections and Appendix A for the full survey tool.\nA total of 2,208 usable responses were received, constituting a 2.9% response rate, which is better than recent average response rates for randomized household surveys (CSU Institute for Social Research), and a margin of error of plus or minus 2.1%, given a 95% confidence interval. Survey analyses are based on weighted data to ensure results reflect demographically-representative sentiments. All details on methodology for survey design, distribution, data weighting and analysis can be found in Appendix B [of the Summary Report]."
