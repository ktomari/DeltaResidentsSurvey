# Delta Residents Survey 2023

Thank you for your interest in the the 2023 Delta Residents Survey. For more information about the survey itself (including reports and documentation), visit the (separate) [DRS GitHub Page](https://ktomari.github.io/DeltaResidentsSurvey/).

## Source Code

While this repository contains an earlier version of the source code (drs_functions.R) used to read the DRS data set, we encourage you to instead utilize the [package {cdrs}](https://github.com/ktomari/cdrs) which is currently in development. Core functions that help you read the DRS data and configure statistical analyses are available with this package.
